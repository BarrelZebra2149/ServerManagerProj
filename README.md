**ServerManagerProj** 🚀

A small collection of Jupyter notebooks and helper scripts for documenting and managing a simple server/network setup.

**Repository Structure** 📁
- **Overview:** Short description of each file in the repository.
- **Files:**
  - 🐚 [jupyter_lab_execute.sh](jupyter_lab_execute.sh): Shell helper to run Jupyter Lab (Linux/macOS). Adjust for Windows or WSL as needed.
  - 📓 [Jupyter_setting.ipynb](Jupyter_setting.ipynb): Notebook with Jupyter configuration, settings, and examples.
  - 🧭 [ServerManage.ipynb](ServerManage.ipynb): Main notebook demonstrating server management tasks and workflows.
  - 🌐 [server_network.yaml](server_network.yaml): YAML describing the server/network configuration used by the notebooks or tools.

**Purpose** 💡
- Provide interactive examples and documented workflows for managing servers and simple network configurations using Jupyter notebooks and a small helper script.

**Prerequisites** ⚙️
- Python 3.8+ and `pip` (for running any Python code in the notebooks).
- Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed. Install using:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

- On Windows, run notebooks via Anaconda / Jupyter launcher or use WSL to run the shell helper.

**Usage** ⚡
- Open the repository in your preferred environment and launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook, then open the notebooks:
  - 🧾 [ServerManage.ipynb](ServerManage.ipynb) — walkthrough for server tasks.
  - ⚙️ [Jupyter_setting.ipynb](Jupyter_setting.ipynb) — settings and environment notes.
- To run the helper script (on compatible systems):

```bash
./jupyter_lab_execute.sh
```

**server_network.yaml** 🗂️
- This file contains network/server configuration used by the notebooks. Inspect and adapt it for your environment before running any automated tasks.

**Contributing** 🤝
- Feel free to open issues or submit PRs with improvements, additional examples, or platform-specific instructions (Windows, Docker, WSL).

**Notes** 📝
- This repository is primarily a set of example notebooks and a simple helper script — adapt as needed for production use.
